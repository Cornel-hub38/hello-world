# hello-world
Repository for all the coding files I will be creating over and beyond the bootcamp course in London
hello, my name is Cornel.  I am applying for the bootcamp in london starting in February 2017.  This will be a change in career for me to become a full time professional programmer. I did some programming in C and C++ at university a long time ago and have even developed some very rudimentary web pages using HTML, in the days before javascript and CSS.  My intention is to relearn what Iknew then and to learn as much as possible and as fast a possible by taking advantage of the availabale trainers and other resources that are being made avaialable for this learning process.  I think that Founders and coders is a great idea and are doing great things in the community and that the online help which can be gained by visiting sites such as FreeCodeCamp is absolutely fantastic.
